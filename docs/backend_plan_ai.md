### Pipecat-Flows Agent-to-Agent Backend Documentation

Below is updated backend documentation to account for using **pipecat-flows** for an agent-to-agent (AI vs AI) chat app—streamlining real-time, multimodal (voice/text) interactions and orchestration.

## Architecture Overview

**Pipecat-Flows** enables declarative, structured conversational flows and automates session, state, and model management. The main FastAPI server acts as an API/WebSocket gateway; all agent conversation and transitions are handled by Pipecat pipelines.

- **FastAPI backend** acts as the edge API server.
- **Pipecat Flows engine** defines and runs agent-vs-agent conversation logic, with explicit nodes for roles, turn switches, and conversation phases (e.g., flirt → roast).
- **Audio/text** is streamed via WebSocket.
- **Frontend** presents streamed audio/dialog and handles user settings.

| Socket Transport    | Pipecat’s FastAPIWebsocketTransport               |
| Conversation Logic  | pipecat-flows (pip install pipecat-ai-flows)      |
| AI Models           | OpenAI, Google (or local models via Pipecat)      |
| TTS                 | Pipecat's built-in TTS modules or service plugins |
| State               | In-process (for ephemeral) or Redis/Postgres      |
| Orchestration       | Pipecat FlowManager                               |
| Frontend            | (Your choice—React, Vue, etc.)                    |
| Animations/Avatars  | Custom (your UI stack; sync to Pipecat events)    |

## API and Data Flow

*All agent turns, phase switches, and voice rendering are managed inside the Pipecat pipeline. The backend only exposes API/WebSocket endpoints and session management.*

- **Frontend connects to FastAPI backend** (usually via `/ws` for audio/text stream).
- **Session is created/managed**; conversation flow launches according to uploaded or hardcoded Pipecat flow config (with roles and phases for Agent A and Agent B).
- **Each agent turn triggers:**
  - LLM processing (one agent speaks per node/turn)
  - TTS synthesis on agent output (handled in the flow)
  - Audio streamed to frontend; frontend can overlay custom animation events
- **Phase transitions** (e.g., flirt → roast) are defined within the flow (by node transitions, triggers, or counter).

### Example Mermaid Diagram

This shows the system architecture and core data flow with Pipecat-Flows orchestrating both agents from a single backend process:

## How the Stack Fits Together

- **FastAPI**: Runs your main API server and websocket endpoints.
- **Pipecat-Flows**: Defines the entire conversational process as a flow—explicitly setting up turn-taking between agents, phases, and message logic. Handles all LLM and TTS calls in the pipeline.
- **WebSocket**: Used for real-time streaming of agent speech/audio, text, and events to the frontend; also allows the frontend to catch events for animation triggers.
- **Frontend**: Binds with the websocket, displays the conversation, plays generated audio, and triggers your custom avatar/animation logic for each agent’s turn.
- **State/persistence**: (Optional but recommended for multi-user) Use Redis, Postgres, or similar to manage session storage if needed.

## Pipecat-Flows Agent-to-Agent Flow Features

- Each agent’s persona, prompt logic, and turn/phase behavior defined in flow nodes.
- Flows can be edited/visualized using the [Pipecat Flows Editor][1] for optimal maintainability.
- TTS and LLM are plug-n-play: you can switch providers as required.
- All chat/TTS and agent switching is in a single process—no need for multiple FastAPI servers or duplicated orchestration logic.
- Your frontend can easily overlay **custom animations** in sync with audio/text/player events received through the websocket.

**This stack leverages Pipecat-Flows’ strengths for coordinated, multimodal AI-to-AI voice interaction, combining robust Python backend, structured dialog flows, and easy frontend customizability for maximum effect.**[2][1][3][4]
