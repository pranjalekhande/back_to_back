For a Python-based backend that powers your interactive AI-human roasting
chat app (with dynamic LLM, TTS, and scalable web capabilities),
consider this modern tech stack:

## Recommended Python Tech Stack

### 1. **Web Framework**
- **FastAPI**
  - Async, high-performance REST and WebSocket support.
  - Well-suited for integrating AI and TTS APIs.
  - Gives automatic API docs and validation with Pydantic.

### 2. **Language Model and TTS Integration**
- Use Python SDKs or HTTP libraries to connect with:
  - **OpenAI API** for GPT (openai Python SDK or HTTPX/requests).
  - **Google Cloud/AWS Polly/Coqui TTS** for Text-to-Speech (HTTPX or
  their official SDKs).

### 3. **Session State and Persistence**
- **Redis**: Fast in-memory store for live session/chat state (great for ephemeral,
multi-user chat).
- **PostgreSQL or SQLite**: Persistent database for user data, conversation archives,
moderation logs.

### 4. **Background Task Queue (optional but highly recommended for scale)**
- **Celery** with **Redis** or **RabbitMQ**: For offloading heavy or concurrent TTS/LLM calls.

### 5. **Asynchronous HTTP Library**
- **HTTPX**: Fully async; ideal for calling external APIs in FastAPI endpoints.
- Alternative: **aiohttp**.

### 6. **Task Scheduling (for cleanup, cron jobs, etc.)**
- **APScheduler**: Integrates cleanly with FastAPI for background cleanup or session expiry.

### 7. **Object Storage (for audio files)**
- **Amazon S3** (boto3) or **MinIO** (S3-compatible, local): For storing and serving synthesized audio,
especially if audio is not streamed instantly.

### 8. **Content Moderation**
- Use Python packages or service APIs for filtering (e.g., OpenAI Moderation API).

### 9. **Testing**
- **pytest**: Industry-standard for Python backend testing.
- **httpx**, **requests-mock**: For endpoint and integration tests.

## Why This Stack?

- **All are robust, modern, and widely used in the Python ecosystem.**
- Fits both fast prototyping and scalable production.
- Async support throughout enables fast LLM/TTS roundtrips.
- Easy to containerize (Docker) and deploy (Heroku, AWS, GCP, custom VM).
- Huge open-source and commercial support.

You can mix and match these pieces depending on complexity (skip Celery or Redis
if you’re building a prototype), but this stack covers both MVP and
production-readiness for your app’s requirements.
